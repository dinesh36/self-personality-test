      You feel that living alone is to live happily, and you prefer hiding in a crowd rather than standing out in one. You are perpetually tormented by the idea of doing things wrong, not understanding or not being alert enough or intelligent enough to do what others expect of you. You lack in self-confidence and you seem to believe that others are better than you. While in a conversation, for example, you would be more likely to go.
